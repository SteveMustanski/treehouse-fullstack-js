# treehouse-fullstack-js

This repo contains work from the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript track.  I've gone through this to get some practice plus learn a few things. 

The track on treehouse covers JS basics, which I've skipped in this repo.  I've focused mostly on node, express, gulp, and mongo in this repo.
